Hi there!  
I'm Cilyan, a former coder, developper and open-source enthusiast.

I used to have a blog of mine mainly about my findings and thoughts in the world
of coding, hacking and managing computer systems and I mostly talked about Linux
🐧, Python 🐍, C 💻 and embedded platforms 🚗.

With my new activities, I stopped writing long ago and shut the website down. I
asked that old articles that are still relevant are hosted here so they may be
useful to those who find them.

**Think & Code**
